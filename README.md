# Adding Push Notifications to a Web App

This is from a Google Codelab that teaches you how to add push notifications to a web app. You can learn how to do it by following the step-by-step available [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/push-notifications).

#### How to run

In order to run this locally, you must download [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) app. After that, open the app and click the "choose folder" button. Select the "app" folder. Also, check "Automatically show index.html" box. Then you can open the project by clicking on the Web Server URL.

Now, generate an application server keys with [Push Companion](https://web-push-codelab.appspot.com) and copy your public key into ```scripts/main.js``` replacing the ```<Your Public Key>``` value. 

You can already try it! Don't forget to use Google Chrome's console.
